# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive interactive knowledge management system using Svelte that enables users to build, organize, and interact with high-quality learning content. The system will provide tools for creating interactive educational materials, organizing knowledge hierarchically, and facilitating effective learning through dynamic content presentation and user engagement features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to create interactive learning modules with rich content types, so that I can build engaging educational materials that enhance understanding and retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new learning module THEN the system SHALL provide a rich content editor supporting text, images, videos, code snippets, and interactive elements
2. WHEN a user adds interactive elements THEN the system SHALL support quizzes, flashcards, drag-and-drop exercises, and clickable diagrams
3. WHEN a user saves content THEN the system SHALL automatically version the content and maintain edit history
4. IF a user includes code examples THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and live code execution capabilities
5. WHEN a user embeds media THEN the system SHALL optimize loading and provide responsive display across devices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to navigate through knowledge content in a structured way, so that I can follow logical learning paths and track my progress effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the knowledge base THEN the system SHALL display content organized in a hierarchical tree structure
2. WHEN a user completes a learning module THEN the system SHALL track progress and unlock dependent modules
3. WHEN a user searches for content THEN the system SHALL provide full-text search with filtering by content type, difficulty, and tags
4. IF a user bookmarks content THEN the system SHALL maintain a personal collection accessible from any device
5. WHEN a user reviews completed content THEN the system SHALL show spaced repetition recommendations based on forgetting curves

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to organize and link related knowledge pieces, so that I can create interconnected learning experiences that show relationships between concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates content THEN the system SHALL allow tagging with multiple categories and difficulty levels
2. WHEN a user links content pieces THEN the system SHALL create bidirectional relationships and display connection graphs
3. WHEN a user views content THEN the system SHALL suggest related materials based on tags, content similarity, and user behavior
4. IF content has prerequisites THEN the system SHALL enforce learning order and show dependency chains
5. WHEN a user explores topics THEN the system SHALL provide visual knowledge maps showing concept relationships

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the knowledge system to adapt to my learning style and pace, so that I can optimize my learning efficiency and retention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with content THEN the system SHALL track engagement metrics including time spent, completion rates, and interaction patterns
2. WHEN a user demonstrates mastery THEN the system SHALL adjust content difficulty and pacing automatically
3. WHEN a user struggles with concepts THEN the system SHALL provide additional resources and alternative explanations
4. IF a user has learning preferences THEN the system SHALL customize content presentation (visual, auditory, kinesthetic styles)
5. WHEN a user returns to the system THEN the system SHALL provide personalized dashboards showing progress, recommendations, and review items

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a collaborative learner, I want to share knowledge and learn from others, so that I can benefit from collective intelligence and contribute to the community knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates high-quality content THEN the system SHALL allow sharing with specific users or making public
2. WHEN a user finds useful content THEN the system SHALL provide rating, commenting, and annotation capabilities
3. WHEN multiple users work on content THEN the system SHALL support collaborative editing with conflict resolution
4. IF a user contributes valuable content THEN the system SHALL provide reputation scoring and recognition features
5. WHEN a user needs help THEN the system SHALL facilitate peer-to-peer learning through discussion forums and study groups

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data-conscious user, I want my learning data to be portable and secure, so that I can maintain control over my knowledge base and learning analytics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user stores content THEN the system SHALL provide local-first storage with optional cloud synchronization
2. WHEN a user wants to export data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including JSON, Markdown, and standard learning formats (SCORM, xAPI)
3. WHEN a user accesses the system THEN the system SHALL work offline with automatic synchronization when connectivity returns
4. IF a user wants to migrate data THEN the system SHALL provide import/export tools for popular knowledge management formats
5. WHEN a user manages privacy THEN the system SHALL allow granular control over data sharing and analytics collection
