# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create a comprehensive web content sourcing and transformation system that enables users to discover, import, and convert web-based content into interactive learning articles. The system will provide tools for fetching content from various web sources, processing and cleaning the content, and transforming it into structured interactive modules that integrate seamlessly with the existing Interactive Knowledge System.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to import content from web sources like articles, documentation, and research papers, so that I can quickly create interactive learning materials from existing high-quality content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL fetch the web page content and extract the main article text, images, and metadata
2. WHEN a user imports content THEN the system SHALL clean and structure the HTML content while preserving formatting and semantic meaning
3. WHEN a user processes web content THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and extract code snippets, diagrams, and other structured elements
4. IF a user imports from supported platforms THEN the system SHALL use specialized extractors for sites like Medium, GitHub, Wikipedia, and documentation sites
5. WHEN a user imports content THEN the system SHALL preserve source attribution and provide proper citation information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a knowledge curator, I want to manage and organize imported web content sources, so that I can maintain a library of source materials and track their usage in interactive articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user imports content THEN the system SHALL store source metadata including URL, title, author, publication date, and last accessed date
2. WHEN a user manages sources THEN the system SHALL provide a searchable library of imported content with filtering by domain, content type, and import date
3. WHEN a user views source content THEN the system SHALL show the original imported content alongside any transformed versions
4. IF a user updates source content THEN the system SHALL detect changes and offer to refresh the imported content
5. WHEN a user organizes sources THEN the system SHALL allow tagging, categorization, and creation of source collections

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an automated content processor, I want to transform imported web content into structured interactive learning blocks, so that users can quickly create engaging educational materials from raw content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is imported THEN the system SHALL automatically segment text into logical content blocks based on headings, paragraphs, and semantic structure
2. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for interactive elements including quizzes, flashcards, code examples, interactive visualizations, charts, graphs, and dynamic simulations
3. WHEN transforming content THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate content block types for different sections and identify static content that can be made interactive (text, code, image, quiz, interactive-visualization, chart, simulation)
4. IF content contains technical information THEN the system SHALL automatically generate quiz questions, flashcards, and interactive visualizations from key concepts and data
5. WHEN content contains static images or diagrams THEN the system SHALL analyze them for interactive potential and suggest dynamic alternatives (e.g., neural network diagrams become interactive simulators, charts become manipulable visualizations)
6. WHEN processing domain-specific content THEN the system SHALL create contextually appropriate interactive elements (e.g., neural networks with adjustable parameters, financial charts with interactive controls, scientific simulations with variable inputs)
7. WHEN content is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain traceability between original source content and generated interactive blocks, including the reasoning for interactive transformations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content integrator, I want the web sourcing system to work seamlessly with the existing Interactive Knowledge System, so that imported content becomes part of the unified knowledge base.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is imported THEN the system SHALL create new KnowledgeNode entries that integrate with the existing knowledge tree
2. WHEN processing imported content THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest relationships with existing content based on topic similarity and keywords
3. WHEN content is transformed THEN the system SHALL use the existing ContentBlock and ContentModule interfaces for consistency
4. IF imported content relates to existing modules THEN the system SHALL suggest prerequisite relationships and learning paths
5. WHEN content is integrated THEN the system SHALL update search indices and content recommendations to include the new material

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure and manage web content sources through MCP server tools, so that I can automate content discovery and import processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the MCP server SHALL provide tools for managing content source configurations and extraction rules
2. WHEN processing content THEN the MCP server SHALL offer batch import capabilities for multiple URLs or RSS feeds
3. WHEN monitoring sources THEN the MCP server SHALL provide tools for tracking source health, update frequency, and import success rates
4. IF content sources change THEN the MCP server SHALL provide notification and re-import capabilities
5. WHEN managing the system THEN the MCP server SHALL offer content validation, duplicate detection, and quality assessment tools

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want static content to be transformed into interactive visualizations and simulations, so that I can explore concepts dynamically and gain deeper understanding through hands-on interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content contains charts or graphs THEN the system SHALL create interactive versions with hover details, zoom capabilities, and data manipulation controls
2. WHEN content describes systems or processes THEN the system SHALL generate interactive simulations where users can adjust parameters and observe outcomes
3. WHEN content includes technical diagrams THEN the system SHALL create interactive versions with clickable components, adjustable parameters, and real-time feedback
4. IF content describes algorithms or mathematical concepts THEN the system SHALL provide interactive demonstrations with step-by-step visualization and parameter adjustment
5. WHEN content contains data visualizations THEN the system SHALL enable users to filter, sort, and manipulate the underlying data to explore different perspectives
6. WHEN processing domain-specific content THEN the system SHALL create appropriate interactive elements (neural network simulators for AI content, circuit simulators for electronics, molecular viewers for chemistry)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want control over web content sourcing and storage, so that I can manage data retention, source attribution, and content licensing appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing content THEN the system SHALL respect robots.txt files and rate limiting to avoid overloading source servers
2. WHEN storing content THEN the system SHALL provide options for local-only storage or cloud synchronization based on user preferences
3. WHEN using imported content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper attribution and licensing information for all source materials
4. IF content has usage restrictions THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate access controls and usage limitations
5. WHEN managing data THEN the system SHALL provide tools for content expiration, source removal, and compliance with content licensing terms
